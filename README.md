# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This **Movie Recommendation System** is a content-based filtering system that suggests similar movies based on a selected title. 
Built using **Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit**, it provides an interactive user interface for discovering movies effortlessly.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Search for any movie** to get relevant recommendations
- 🎭 **Content-based filtering** using cosine similarity
- 🎨 **Streamlit-powered web interface**
- 📸 **Custom background image** for enhanced UI
- ⚡ **Fast and responsive suggestions**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Streamlit** – Web application framework
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library
- **Pickle** – Model storage and retrieval
- **Base64 & CSS** – UI customization

## 📂 Dataset
The system is built using the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:
- 🎥 Movie titles
- 📜 Overviews & genres
- 🎭 Cast & crew details
- ⭐ User ratings & popularity scores

## 🔧 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned movie descriptions and converted text into numerical format.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Used TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find movie relationships.
3. **Model Development:** Built a recommendation engine based on content similarity.
4. **Web App Development:** Used Streamlit for an interactive UI.
5. **Final Enhancements:** Added a background image, improved text visibility, and optimized performance.
